# Huge_Hello_World_program

A monster 'hello world' program using a massive class, loops, methods, comprehensions, etc. 

I can imagine someone who is learning Python copying this program and typing it out method by method in order to refresh and sharpen their skills. 

This repo is beginner friendly. Just add a method or two that is not already covered in the class and if it is working code, I will add it.
